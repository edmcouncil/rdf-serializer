The rdf-toolkit works with the following major libraries:

# [RDF4J](http://rdf4j.org/)

- Sources - https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j
- Docs - http://docs.rdf4j.org/

The RDF4J API is embedded in the code (currently as Java code) and can be invoked in two ways:

- Through its own Main Class from the command line
- Through the primary command line interface via the `--api rdf4j` switch.
